## Assumptions
- You have a CF deployed
- You have two [proxy](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/tree/develop/src/example-apps/proxy) apps pushed, named appA and appB

## What?

**Routes** are the URLs that can be used to access CF apps.

**Route Mappings** are the join table between routes (URLs) and the apps they send traffic to. Apps can have many routes.
And routes can send traffic to many apps. So Route Mappings is a many-to-many mapping.

## How?

📝 **Create a route that maps to two apps**
0. By default `cf push` creates a route. Look at all of the routes for all of your apps.
 ```
 cf apps
 ```
0. Use curl to hit appA.
 ```
 curl APP_A_URL
 ```
 It should respond with something like `{"ListenAddresses":["127.0.0.1","10.255.116.44"],"Port":8080}`
 We'll get into the listen addresses later, but for now the most important thing to know is that the 10.255.X.X address is the overlay IP address. This IP is unique per app instance.
0. Create your own route (`cf map-route --help`) and map it to both appA **AND** appB.
0. Curl your new route over and over again `watch "curl -sS MY-NEW-ROUTE`".

### Expected Result
You have a route that maps to both appA and appB. See that the overlay IP changes, showing that you are routed evenly(ish) between all the apps mapped to the routes.
